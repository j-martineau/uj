Description: Defines new object types (scalar, vect, mvect, vlist), extended
    classes such as atomic data.frames, extended modes such as non-negative
    whole numbered, fundamental types, shapes, defined dimensionality, effective
    dimensionality, and completeness. Check for any combination of properties
    plus compatibility and comparability of objects; valid element, row, and
    column counts; and valid element values. Robust variable validation, more
    compact and new features for 'apply' functionality, string management,
    failsafe logical functions, and some additional general utility functions
    that make my coding life easier.
